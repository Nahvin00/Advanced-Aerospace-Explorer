2. 'AEX_GUI' folder contains the source files and requirements for the Matlab Application.
3. 'Collision' folder contains space images to be selected to find collision time of moving asteroid.
4. 'Velocity' folder contains space images to be selected to find velocity of moving asteroid.
5. 'AEX IPPR Presentation (Group 1).pptx' is the PowerPoint slide of the final project presentation.
6. To run the Matlab application version of the project, open Matlab and click on 'AEX.mlappinstall' which will install the application on Matlab.
7. Once the application has been successfully installed, you can run the application by navigating to Apps menu at the toolbar.
8. Click on AEX and the GUI should pop-up. (It will take time for the first launch)
9. To run the Basic Matlab coding version of the project, open 'AEX_code.m' in matlab and run it.
10. Make sure to select appropriate images when executing the program to obtain proper results.
11. Have a good day, Thank you!
